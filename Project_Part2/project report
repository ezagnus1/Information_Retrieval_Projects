First we create a hash table for our dictionary. We dedicated 40 for the size. For example, we declare bucket if we find 'a' we insert in 'a' bucket.
Then we change the postings.txt We calculate the tf weight and convert team frequency. Then we calculate length normalization and keep in length_normal.
Then, we do stemming for the queries. We use dictionaries key=docid, value=tf_weight. Then we convert the value=similarity. Then we result_dict write in txt files.
