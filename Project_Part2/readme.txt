A page with the following and signed by all team members: “We have done this
assignment completely on our own except for the software/tools acknowledged in the
project report. We have not copied it, nor have we given our solution to anyone else. We
understand that if we are involved in plagiarism or cheating we will have to sign an
official form that we have cheated and that this form will be stored in our official
university record. We also understand that we will receive a grade of 0 for the involved
assignment and our grades will be reduced by one level (e.g., from A to A- or from B+ to
B) for the first offense, and that we will receive a grade of “F” for the course for any
additional offense of any kind.
