We wrote with pyhton and we use Pyhcharm with 3.7.

For install package:
	
	import math	
	import re	
	from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer	
	import operator


To run:
	python3 Main.py

When you run the program create okaqueryresult.txt and cosqueryresult.txt. You should re-run program for each query. 
When you re-run program you should change txt file names where line 390 and 451. For example you enter first query 
before you run the program change txt files name to okaquery1result.txt and cosquery1result.txt. For second query you 
change again txt files okaquery2result.txt and cosquery2result.txt.
